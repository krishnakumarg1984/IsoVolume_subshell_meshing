<p>The mesh used in a FD/FE discretisation for solid diffusion simulation is often constructed such that the inter-nodal distance ensure that the sub-shells all have equal volumes. This is non-trivial to derive by hand for anything more than 2 or 3 layers. This code performs this automation for you and the complexities are described with a generous dose of inline comments.</p>

<p>Electrochemical reactions usually occur at the surface of the particle, usually modelled as a sphere of fixed radius. For improving simulation accuracy, we need more mesh-points closer to the surface of the sphere. As matter moves towards the sphere's centre, we only need to use lesser and lesser points progressively. In 1D domain, with the left representing the centre, and the right representing the surface, we need a non-uniformly spaced mesh, such that the corresponding spheres represented by the inter-nodal distance have equal volume. </p>

<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h3>

<p>This is a MATLAB script. The code uses only the base MATLAB functions and hence should be compatible with GNU Octave (free!), for those without an active MATLAB license.
As an end-user, you input the sphere radius, the max allowed shells and the desired inter-nodal distance at the surface, (i.e. the smallest mesh-size) and the code generates all the mesh co-ordinates. It also gives you the inter-nodal distances (just in case you wish to use them in your further calculations).</p>
